short-cut- shift+click then alt+ctrl+down key for copy selected in down
ctrl+shift+t see the imported class to see the implementation

For security implementation we have to provide implementation for userdetails

then provide configuration for spring security configuration where we provide all spring security
configuration..

@Query("select u from User u where u.email= :email")
	public User getUserByUserName();
we have to get dynamically email from so we have to provide @Param with pass email so that we can get dynamincally email...


public User getUserByUserName(@Param("email") String email);
Here like that we have to provide dynamincally value...

private User user;
	
	public CustomUserDetails(User user) {
		super();
		this.user = user;
	}

This above code meaning we have to initialize CustomUserDetails becoz when the CustomUserDetails object is created then we have to provide user so that we can
easily get its attribute means email,pass,role etc...
